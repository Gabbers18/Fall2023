## Visualizing Children's Word Learning

### Overview
Young children are exceptional learners, especially when it comes to language. By the age of 12 months, they begin producing simple words, and their phonological processing becomes mature around 18 months. From then until the age of five, children acquire an average of 6-7 words per day.

Rather than learning words randomly or primarily through formal education, children acquire vocabulary based on daily interactions and experiences. This lab explores the factors influencing which words children learn and when, using real-world data from the Wordbank database.

### Objectives: 
- Visualize trends across time
- Visualizing relationships between variables
- Discovering Simpsonâ€™s paradox via visualizations


### **Exercises**  

1. **Get to Know Your Data**  
   - Find the three most commonly produced words by 18-month-olds.  
   - Identify the least likely sound to be produced at 30 months.  

2. **Plot Word Learning Over Time (Sounds Category)**  
   - Plot the proportion of children producing words in the "sounds" category from 16 to 30 months.  
   - Identify the word children tend to know best.  
   - Determine which word is learned the fastest from 16 to 25 months and speculate why.  

3. **Plot Word Learning by Category**  
   - Create a plot showing word learning trajectories for different categories (e.g., sounds, body parts, pronouns, etc.).  
   - Use facets or linetypes to differentiate categories.  

4. **Word Frequency & Learning**  
   - List the 10 most and least frequent words in the dataset.  
   - Plot the relationship between word frequency and the proportion of children producing the word at 24 months, using log-transformed frequency.  
   - Add a linear fit and describe the relationship (positive, negative, or non-existent).  

5. **Faceted Plot by Category**  
   - Recreate the previous plot but facet by word category.  
   - Compare the relationships observed in this plot vs. the previous one.  

6. **Qualitative Analysis**  
   - Consider why some word categories are harder for children to learn despite being common.  
   - Reflect on how words used in books differ from words heard by toddlers.  
   - Identify low-frequency word categories that children might hear often despite low representation in books.  
   - Find the most frequent words in categories that are hard for children to learn (e.g., quantifiers, connecting words) and consider how often children hear them.
